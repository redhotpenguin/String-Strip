This is the README file for String::Strip

String::Strip is an XS extension that implements four white space
removal routines: StripSpace (remove all white space), StripLSpace
(strip leading white space), StripTSpace (strip trailing white space),
and StripLTSpace (strip leading and trailing white space). All four of
these routines work directly on the input argument, rather than
passing back a result. The routines tend to be roughly 30% faster than
equivalent function regex code.

To build and install this extension, simply enter:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

String::Strip requires perl 5.004 or greater.
